# MrNewbPosters

This repository represents an attempt to refine the original MrNewbPosters script. The initial release suffered from various issues, including security vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, I've revisited and started to enhance the script.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to improve the functionality, security, and overall quality of the MrNewbPosters script. By updating the codebase, I aim to incorporate modern practices, enhance code readability, and mitigate security risks present in the original version.

## Changes Made

- Integrated a bridge for compatibility with both QBCore and ESX frameworks.
- Made minor enhancements to ensure proper functionality within both frameworks.
- Addressed immediate security concerns.

## Planned Improvements

While the script is now operational and compatible with both QBCore and ESX, there are still areas for improvement:

- Conduct a comprehensive code cleanup to remove redundant or unnecessary code.
- Implement modern practices and coding conventions for better maintainability.
- Enhance security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
- Optimize performance for better efficiency.
- Add target support.
- Add item support.
- Change positions to global states to prevent overlap.
- Add job to config to make it casual or a framework job.
- Finish progressbar support.
